PACKAGE CONTENTS


-Essentials
    This contains all the crossplatform reference scripts you require to run the project on mobile.
    Some Scripts are customized therefore do not reimport the Standard Assets/Vehicles package  
    The scripts are code commented for your added convenience 


-Custom Scripts
    -CSuspension C#
        Script that amplifies the motion of the movement of the car.
        This Script is for aesthetic purposes. 
        You can reda the comments in it to see how to customize it better.

    -force C#
        This script moves the circuit along to replicate the intelligent behavior posed by the Green Truck.
        This is set on a layer that interacts with Precolliders so that it is in continuous motion.

    - GeneticAlgorithm (Prototyping) C#
        This is a standard prototyping script that is easy to understand and build your own logic on.
        In different sections of the code, please find empty if statements to build further.
        This Script is linked to The AI/NeuralNetwork script. 
        For more information, please refer to documentation on programming AI/Genetic Algorithm. 

    - Helicopter Camera C#
        A lot of basic settings you can toggle and experiment with.
        New Feature: Shake; It works on random motion generated by an in-built library function called "Perlinnoise".
        For more information please see Unity API/Documentation/Perlinnoise

    - NeuralNetwork (Prototyping) C#
        This is a standard prototyping script that is easy to understand and build your own logic on.
        In different sections of the code, please find empty if statements to build further.
        This Script is linked to The AI/GeneticAlgorithm script. 
        For more information, please refer to documentation on programming AI/NeuralNetwork.

    -  Sensors C#
        Sensors are the basic elements or the building blocks of AI/NeuralNetwork and AI/GeneticAlgorithm
        In this script, Raycasts are setup up and this script is partly for prototyping.
        Its basic function is to detect nearby Objects and from there on you can link the GeneticAlgorithm and NeuralNetwork scripts to attain proper functionality.
        You can build your own logic after attaching the given AI scripts for better usability.

    - SimpleMouseRotor C#
        A lot of basic settings you can toggle and experiment with.
        This Script has been taken from the utility package and modified.


-Materials
    Contains some standard Textures and Materials.
    All materials use the standard shader.
    All meshes have UV mapping enabled so the albedos can wrap around.


-Models
    Three Models are provided with this package
        - Standard SkyCar (Unity/packageImport/StandardAssets/Vehicles/Models/SkyCar)
        - Trucker (Orange as provided in the ExampleScenes)
        - Truck  (Green/Florecent as provided in the ExampleScenes)


-PhysicDynamicCircuitMaterial
    Contains one physic material called "Bounce" that assists the Truck to exhibit intelligent behavior through the Follow Circuit Script


-Documentation
    Contains all the information you need to make the best out of this project

-IntelligentChaseAI
    In this seen you will see the basic setup of your Car that you can drive on the Left hand side.
    You have full control over the camera for both sides of the screen
    If you want to remove the camera control from either of the two, in the Hierarchy, go to camera/cameraAI and disable the Scripts attached.
    On the right hand of the screen you have Intelligent Car setup that makes use of the Waypoint Navigation at first.
    After you have developed the logic for AI and made use of the sensors provided, The Car will behave differently after Machine learning through procedurally generated codes.

                                                    Other Stats
- Workability
    Light weight and runs at 200+ FPS with less than 1M tris/verts/faces with Nvidia Geforce 710 Graphics card and Intel i3 processor

Most Of the Code is commented so you will have no trouble using this package in its entirety.
